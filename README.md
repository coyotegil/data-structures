# Data Structures in C

This repo contains a collection of useful Data Structures algorithms and a few use cases implemented in C.

## 1) Mergesort

A simple algorithm for sorting a random vector v of lenght n using a recursive strategy.

## 2) Queues

An implementation of a basic Circular Queue applied to a simple use case of finding the distances between connected cities.
